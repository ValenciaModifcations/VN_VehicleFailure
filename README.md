# VN_VehicleFailure

VN_VehicleFailure is specifically designed for ND_Core ([ND_Core GitHub](https://github.com/ND-Framework/ND_Core/tree/main))

This is a modified version of [RealisticVehicleFailure](https://github.com/iEns/RealisticVehicleFailure) modernized and modified by Josh F and Shawn V of Valencia Networks. All rights reserved. We received assistance from TheStoicBear, a staff member in the ND_Framework's Discord.

## ND_CORE REQUIRED!!!

This script will likely not work without ND_Core. Please visit the [RealisticVehicleFailure GitHub link](https://github.com/iEns/RealisticVehicleFailure) for a standalone version.

## Features / Usage

Tied into the economy, the price of repair scales with damage to the vehicle. 
If you aren't at a mechanic shop, do `/repair`. If you are, do `/mrepair`. 

## Notice

This is the bare-bones version of this script. I intend to develop a more sophisticated script with HTML, allowing players to roleplay as mechanics and make money.
